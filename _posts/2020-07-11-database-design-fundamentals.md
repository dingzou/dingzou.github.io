- Database Management System: If an organization wants to adopt the database approach, then it needs a collection of programs that enable the users of the organization to create and maintain databases and control all access to them. This is achieved using a database management system (DBMS). The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information.
- Data Modeling: A data model is a collection of concepts or notations for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and data constraints.

- Entity-relationship data model is a high-level conceptual data model that has existed over 35 years. It is well suited to data modeling for use with databases because it is fairly abstract and is easy to discuss and explain. ER models, also called ER schemas, are represented by ER diagrams.

- Normalization: Normalization is the branch of relational theory that provides design insights. It is the process of determining how much redundancy exists in a table. The goals of normalization are to: 1) Be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a relational schema. 2) Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy.

- Structured Query Language
	- SELECT
	- WHERE
	- AND & OR
	- ORDERED BY & GROUP BY
	- HAVING
	- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
